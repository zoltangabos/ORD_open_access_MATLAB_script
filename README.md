This is an openly available post processing (MATLAB) script to extract the BBC behaviour of simple vibrating nonlinear systems, and quantify their cubic nonlinearity.

The operational resonance decay (ORD) method is a transient method, where the underlying mechanical system can be under excitation while extracting the BBC.
More information about the ORD method can be read in:
